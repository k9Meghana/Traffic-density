Traffic Density Control System:

        In our country,we are observing that there is huge traffic and there is no certain solution to control it. Many people are facing the same situation not only in our country but over the world , this problem is same.

Why Traffic?

    • Commonly we never think that why the traffic is caused , the reason is traffic is caused due to high volume of vehicles that passing through an area. 
    • Actually there is no traffic at some hours of the day. But we observe this traffic at some peak hours like workers leaving from office at one time.
    • People leaving from their home town for their essential needs.
    • Students traveling certain distance to reach their schools and leaving from the school..etc


How to Control?

    • There are certain techniques are being followed to control the traffic.
    • A Traffic Density Control System is designed to manage the flow of traffic by monitoring and controlling traffic volumes on roads to prevent congestion, reduce delays, and improve overall road safety and efficiency.

Sensors and Data Collection:

    • In this system, we used IR sensors and Ultrasonic sensors and LCD display and LED’s.
    • For detection of vehicles, IR sensors are been used. This sensors detect the motion of vehicles or any thing.
    • For knowing the distance between the vehicle and the traffic signal ,Ultrasonic sensor is used. This sensor generates a sound wave and when the wave hits any object ,it sends the distance from sensor to the object.
    • LCD display is used to display the alert messages.
    • All the sensors are connected to Arduino board and being processed.


Working Principle:
    • This system works on the principle of motion detection and processing. When an IR sensor detects the motion of any vehicle, Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the vehicle and sensor .
    • If the distance is small, it allows the vehicle to pass automatically by glowing green LED.
    • If the distance is large, it glows yellow LED.
    • If two lanes are used, then if in one way  vehicles are passing, then other way vehicles are stopped by glowing red LED.
    • It can also alert the messages in an LCD display.




Components:

    • Arduino uno
    • IR sensors
    • Ultrasonic sensors
    • LCD display
    • LED’s
    • Breadboard
    • Connecting wires

Procedure:

    • Connect VCC to 5v on arduino and ground pin to GND.
    • Connect IR sensor to arduino board.
    • Connect Ultrasonic sensor to Arduino and specify the pins.
    • Connect LCD display and LED’s to Arduino.
    • After connecting all the sensors to arduino, write  a C or C++ code in the code block.
    • Upload the code and observe the output.

Benefits:
    • Reduced Congestion: By adjusting signal timings, managing lanes, and rerouting traffic, congestion is reduced, resulting in smoother traffic flow.
    • Shorter Travel Times: Optimized traffic control can lead to faster movement through intersections and roads.
    • Lower Emissions: When traffic moves efficiently, cars spend less time idling, which can reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
    • Improved Road Safety: Through better management of traffic, particularly in busy intersections and high-density areas, the likelihood of accidents and collisions can be minimized.
    • Cost Efficiency: Effective traffic control can save on road maintenance and emergency response costs by reducing accidents and road wear
